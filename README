this workspace contains a running uart example based on the liblpc LPC1769 library.
It also contains a LPC1769 port of BTStack.
  
  I have run into an issue with the port. The program is able send a couple HCI command and receive and acknowledgement packet
  for the CC2540. However when i try to send the set avertisment command i dont get a response from the CC2540. 
  
  reason why we think this is happening include:
  unimplented CTS handler:
    the uart communication between the LPC and the bluetooth module uses the CTS/RTS lines for control flow. In other words 
    the RTS tell the CC2540 that is should send data and CTS comming from the CC2540 tells the LPC that is can send data. 
    In port example for the MSP430 type MCU they included a IRQ handler and A CTS setup. I did not implement this because on 
    the LPC CTS is handle differently.
    
  Incorrect intialization of the HCI (FIXED):
     Before the issue was resolved, the Printf in the code segment 
                case BTSTACK_EVENT_STATE:
          		// bt stack activated, get started - set local name
        			if (packet[2] == HCI_STATE_WORKING) {
        				printf("Working!\n");
        				HCI_WORKING = 1;
        				hci_send_cmd(&hci_read_local_supported_features);
        			}
        			break;
              
      never ran. The reason why the problem arose was becasue of the way the packet handler in the main file was setup.
      While the HCI init was running and sending commands the receive packet were causing side effects that ulitimately 
      stopped the HCI init fuction from completing. THus it never send the internal packet to print out ("Working!\n")
      
      It is important to note that this did not fix the original issue.
      
  probing some more.
